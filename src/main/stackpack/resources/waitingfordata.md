## The Splunk StackPack is waiting for data

The StackState API-Integration Agent and/or StackState Agent V2 must be configured with a Splunk Agent check for each type of data you want to retrieve from Splunk. You can choose to retrieve topology, metrics, events and/or health data.

Details of how to configure each of these checks can be found on the pages listed below:

* [Splunk topology V2 check with StackState Agent V2](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunktopologyv2)
* [Splunk topology V1 check with the API-Integration Agent](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunktopologyv1)
* [Splunk metrics check configuration](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunkmetrics)
* [Splunk events check configuration](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunkevents)
