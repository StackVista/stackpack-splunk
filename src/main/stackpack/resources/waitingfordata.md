## The Splunk StackPack is waiting for data

StackState Agent V2 must be configured with a Splunk Agent check for each type of data you want to retrieve from Splunk. You can choose to retrieve topology, metrics, events and/or health data.

Details of how to configure each of these checks can be found on the pages listed below:

* [Splunk topology check configuration](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunktopologyv2)
* [Splunk metrics check configuration](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunkmetrics)
* [Splunk events check configuration](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunkevents)
* [Splunk health check configuration](/#/stackpacks/splunk-topology/splunkhealth)
