## The Splunk StackPack is waiting for data

The StackState API-Integration Agent and/or StackState Agent V2 must be configured with a Splunk Agent check for each type of data you want to retrieve from Splunk. You can choose to retrieve topology, metrics, events and/or health data.

Details of how to configure each of these checks can be found on the pages listed below:

* [Splunk topology V2 check with StackState Agent V2 \(docs.stackstate.com\)](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/integrations/splunk/splunk_topology_v2.md)
