## The Splunk StackPack is waiting for data

The StackState API-Integration Agent and/or StackState Agent V2 must be configured with a Splunk Agent check for each type of data you want to retrieve from Splunk. You can choose to retrieve topology, metrics, events and/or health data.

Details of how to configure each of these checks can be found on the pages listed below:
