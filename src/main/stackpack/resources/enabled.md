## The StackState Splunk StackPack is installed

Congratulations! The StackState Splunk StackPack is configured correctly. Data is received.

### What's next

Now that StackState has the topology from your Splunk instance, you can see your topology in the Splunk view.

### Disabling the Splunk StackPack

The Splunk StackPack can be disabled by clicking the **Uninstall** button on the right. This will disable all Splunk specific configuration in StackState but the agent will be still collecting the data until it is completely deprovisioned.
